## Stage Status

| Stage | Scope | Status | Verification |
|-------|-------|--------|--------------|
| S1.1 | Repository Skeleton (10 top-level folders, `.gitignore`, `.editorconfig`) | ✅ Complete, approved, committed | Structure matches IP-001 §6; documentation untouched |
| S1.2A | Backend Foundation (FastAPI factory, DI, config hierarchy, structured logging, middleware, error taxonomy, health/ready/live/metrics, `/api/v1`) | ✅ Complete, approved, committed | Full runtime verification on Python 3.13.14 / uv 0.11.29 — all endpoints, correlation propagation, ES-002 envelopes, structured logs |
| S1.2B | Backend Infrastructure Foundation (SQLAlchemy 2.x + ES-003 base mixins, Alembic, PostgreSQL/Redis/Kafka managers, Repository base, Unit of Work, async health checks, Celery worker foundation) | ✅ Complete, approved | Runtime-verified: startup, graceful degradation (ARCH-001 §14), health endpoints reporting accurate per-dependency status, module integrity (18 modules), ORM DDL conformance to ES-003, Celery app + `platform.ping` registration, Alembic config load. Live connectivity: **deferred — see D-S001-01** |
| S1.3 | Frontend Foundation (Next.js 15 App Router, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui CSS variables, TanStack Query, Zustand auth store, React Hook Form + Zod deps, Apache ECharts dep, API client with ES-002 envelope + correlation IDs, auth library skeleton, route middleware, `/api/health` route, root providers tree) | ✅ Complete, approved | TypeScript strict-mode compilation clean; module integrity verified (package.json, next.config.ts, tsconfig.json, tailwind.config.ts, 5 providers, 2 lib modules, 1 store, 1 hook, 8 app routes/layouts); auth OIDC flows and full navigation deferred to IP-002 per design |
| S1.4 | Shared Libraries (12-package set per IP-001 §9: added constants, exceptions, validation, security, monitoring, events, auth; relocations with compatibility re-exports; RA-006 §8 event envelope + BP-004 §11 naming + Kafka publisher protocol binding + outbox contract/model; pytest foundation) | ✅ Complete | 65 unit tests passing; shared coverage 99.24% (gate ≥95%); full S1.2A/S1.2B endpoint regression byte-equivalent; 30-module import integrity; outbox DDL compile-verified; framework-independence rule verified (no shared→core/api/infrastructure imports). Outbox migration + drain worker deferred per D-S001-01 |
| S1.5 | Configuration Framework (secret-provider interfaces + local providers at IP-001 §10 priority 2; environment profiles `configs/{base,development,testing,staging,production,local}`; platform feature flags with `ATLAS_FEATURE_*` overrides; production-safety and scheme validation; redacted `safe_dump` startup snapshot) | ✅ Complete | 86 unit tests passing (+21); shared coverage 99.08% (gate ≥95%); full endpoint regression byte-equivalent; credential masking verified in startup logs; all four shipped profiles resolve and validate. External vault provider integration deferred to the BP-002 Secrets Service stage by design |
| S1.6 | Containerization (multi-stage backend image python:3.13-slim + uv-frozen; frontend image node:22-alpine Next standalone; shared worker image via command override; repo-root + frontend .dockerignore; Compose dev environment postgres:17-alpine / redis:7-alpine / apache/kafka:3.9.1 KRaft with named volumes, internal network, healthchecks, infra/full profiles; dev-up/dev-down scripts) | ✅ Complete | All 6 containers healthy on first start; `/health` and `/ready` **200 with postgresql/redis/kafka healthy** (first green path); `alembic current` against live PostgreSQL; Kafka publish acknowledged (envelope, acks=all); Celery `platform.ping` round-trip via containerized worker; frontend `/api/health` 200; 86 unit tests passing, coverage 99.08%; no regressions |
| S1.7 – S1.10 | Per approved Repository Bootstrap Plan | Planned | — |

## Recorded Decisions

### D-S001-01 — Live infrastructure connectivity verification deferred to S1.6

- **Decision:** Live green-path connectivity verification for PostgreSQL,
  Redis, and Kafka (successful round-trips, `alembic current` against a
  live database, Kafka publish acknowledgment, Celery worker `platform.ping`
  execution) is intentionally deferred to Sprint-001 Stage S1.6
  (Containerization), where the complete development environment
  (Docker Compose with PostgreSQL, Redis, Kafka per IP-001 §16 and the
  approved Bootstrap Plan §6) is provisioned.
- **Approved by:** Product Owner (Anil Kumar), 2026-07-18, on acceptance of
  the Stage S1.2B verification report (Option 3).
- **Rationale:** The development machine currently has no Docker, WSL, or
  native PostgreSQL/Redis/Kafka services; installing server software ahead
  of the governed containerization stage would pre-empt S1.6 scope.
  Failure-path verification already executed in S1.2B proves the IP-001 §14
  health checks detect real socket-level conditions (connection refused,
  timeout, broker bootstrap failure) and that startup degrades gracefully
  per ARCH-001 §14.
- **Obligation carried to S1.6:** The S1.6 exit criteria are extended to
  include: `/health` and `/ready` returning 200 with `postgresql`, `redis`,
  and `kafka` checks healthy against the Compose environment; `alembic
  current` executing against live PostgreSQL; one acknowledged Kafka
  publish; one successful Celery `platform.ping` round-trip.
- **Status:** ✅ **DISCHARGED — 2026-07-19, Stage S1.6.** Every extended
  exit criterion was executed and passed against the Compose environment:
  `/health` and `/ready` returned 200 with `postgresql`, `redis`, and
  `kafka` checks healthy; `alembic current` executed against live
  PostgreSQL (PostgresqlImpl context); one Kafka publish acknowledged
  (event `019f7980-b995-7357-b008-fc2411882df4`, envelope contract,
  acks=all idempotent producer); one Celery `platform.ping` round-trip
  returned `pong` through the containerized worker.

## Version History

| Date | Entry |
|------|-------|
| 2026-07-18 | Initial log: S1.1, S1.2A, S1.2B recorded; decision D-S001-01 recorded |
| 2026-07-18 | S1.3 Frontend Foundation complete: Next.js 15 App Router scaffold with all canonical dependencies (TanStack Query, Zustand, React Hook Form, Zod, ECharts, axios, shadcn/ui, Radix UI), API client, auth library, Zustand auth store, route middleware, providers tree, route group layouts `(auth)` and `(dashboard)`, `/api/health` route, TypeScript path aliases |
| 2026-07-18 | S1.3 runtime verification completed (pnpm 10.14.0 / Node 22 LTS): production build + full HTTP verification of routing, middleware auth gating, theme, health route. Defects fixed during verification: route collision (`(dashboard)/page.tsx` vs root `/`) and missing `/auth/login`,`/dashboard` URLs; API client/types corrected to the exact ES-002 §7/§17/§9 envelope with `X-Correlation-ID` (UUID v7 per IP-001 §15); root redirect moved to middleware (real 307); `next-themes` bumped to 0.4.x for React 19; `.gitignore` fixed to track `.env.local.example`. Gaps filled: `loading.tsx`, structured logging foundation (`src/lib/logging`), canonical `features/`, `shared/`, `tests/` dirs, `packageManager` pin + `.npmrc` hoisted linker (Windows symlink constraint) |
| 2026-07-19 | **ADR-006 (CORS Strategy) approved by Product Owner** — Option 1 selected as the permanent repository standard: production Same-Origin Only (no CORS headers), development Allowlisted Origins only, wildcards Not Allowed in any environment. Status: Proposed → Accepted (first ADR ratification); recorded in REG-001 and `07_ADRs/README.md`. Implementation remains a Sprint-002 completion gate; no code changed |
| 2026-07-19 | **Governance ratification complete** — Product Owner ratified **CON-001 (Repository Constitution, now in force as v1.0.0)** and **ADR-001, ADR-002, ADR-003, ADR-004, ADR-005, ADR-007** (all Proposed → Accepted). Combined with the earlier ADR-006 approval, the full governance set (Constitution + all 7 ADRs) is Accepted. Sprint-002 readiness conditions 1–2 discharged. Statuses recorded in the ADR documents, `07_ADRs/README.md`, REG-001, and MAN-001. No code changed. Remaining before baseline freeze: GOV-004 closure approval + freeze commits + tag `baseline-v1.0.0-sprint001` |
| 2026-07-19 | **GOV-004 APPROVED — Sprint-001 formally CLOSED; baseline FROZEN.** Product Owner approved CLS-001 (closure) and BAS-001 (freeze); GOV-004 recorded Accepted in REG-001. BAS-001 Freeze Procedure executed: S1.6 commit `6c11d58`, governance-corpus commit `d7293b0`, annotated tag **`baseline-v1.0.0-sprint001` → commit `d7293b0`**. Sprint-001 is immutable per POL-001 except critical bug fixes. All future work begins from Sprint-002 |
